                    <p>The beginning of Dhwani could be traced back to 1999 wherein it was merely a side show to the CETEX exhibition celebrating 60 years of CET.

                        cultural festival of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2000.
                         There in efforts were put forward to realise an annual festival for one of the most prestigious institution in Southern India.</p>
